# Bevy_Godot4

<!-- > **NOTICE**: This crate is currrently unmaintained, and due to changes in gdext's api it is pinned to an old version of gdext and only works with Godot 4.0 -->

Bring the design power of Bevy's ECS to the mature engine capabilities of Godot 4.

The architecture in this crate mimics that of [bevy_godot](https://github.com/rand0m-cloud/bevy_godot), a similar crate for working with Godot 3 and GDNative.

## Setup

1. Follow the steps outlined in the [GDExtension Getting Started](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext#getting-started).

2. Add this line to your cargo dependencies (along with the godot dependency from GDExtension setup):  
❗ Consieder using crates.io version of the [godot](https://crates.io/crates/godot) crate, and not the github one ❗
```
[dependencies]
godot = "0.1.3"
bevy_godot4 = { git = "https://github.com/jrockett6/bevy_godot4", branch = "main" }
```
3. Create a function that takes a `&mut App` and builds your bevy app, and annotate it with `#[bevy_app]`:
```rust
#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    app.add_system(my_system)
}
```
4. Cargo build your project, and make sure the dll is found by Godot via the .gdextension file. You should now have the `BevyApp` Node avaiable to you in the Godot editor (you may need to refresh the project in the editor). 

5. Add this `BevyApp` Node as a Godot autoload named `BevyAppSingleton` in the Godot project settings.

## Features

At it's core, this crate is just a Rust GDExtension `Node` holding a Bevy `App` that you add as an autoload in your Godot project. 

This crate also provides utilities to be able to work with Godot nodes from within the Bevy framework, such as...

#### *Godot nodes as components*
`ErasedGd` is a Bevy component that holds Godot node instance id's. You can `Query` for these and `get::<T>()` or `try_get::<T>()`  the node in your systems.
```rust
fn set_positions(mut erased_gds: Query<&mut ErasedGd>) {
    for mut node in erased_gds.iter_mut() {
        if let Some(node2D) = node.try_get::<Node2D>() {
            node2D.set_position(Vector2::ZERO)
        }
    }
}
```

#### *Godot resources as Bevy resources*
Similarly, `ErasedGdResource` is `Send` & `Sync` and can hold your `RefCounted` Godot `Resource` types.
```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
pub struct GodotResources {
    pub my_packed_scene: ErasedGdResource,
}

impl Default for GodotResources {
    // load godot resource with e.g. the ResourceLoader singleton.
}

app.init_resource::<GodotResources>();
```

#### *Spawn Godot scenes from erased PackedScene resources*
`GodotScene` will handle instancing `PackedScene`s, adding them to the scene tree, and adding the corresponding `ErasedGd` to work with from Bevy systems.
```rust
fn spawn_scene(
    godot_resources: Res<GodotResources>,
    mut commands: Commands,
) {
    commands.spawn(GodotScene::from_resource(godot_resources.my_packed_scene.clone()));
}
```

#### *Schedule systems for the _process or _physics_process update loops*
`as_visual_system()` or `as_physics_system()` will ensure your Bevy systems run on the desired Godot update loop.
``` rust
app.add_system(set_positions.as_physics_system())
```

#### *Ensure Bevy systems are run on the main thread*
`SceneTreeRef` is a `NonSend` system param that ensures your Bevy system will be scheduled on the main thread.
```rust
fn my_main_thread_system(
    ...,
    _scene_tree: SceneTreeRef,
) {
    // non-threadsafe code, e.g. move_and_slide()
}
```
